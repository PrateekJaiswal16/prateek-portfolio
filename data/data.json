        "journey": "My journey includes hands-on experience as an SDE Intern at Shram Pvt. Ltd., where I developed responsive UI components with React and implemented a rich text editor. As the Web Dev Lead for GDG, I led the rebuild of our college's official website using React and MySQL. My projects demonstrate my ability to build production-ready systems, such as 'DastaBase AI,' an AI agent using an adaptive RAG pipeline to boost accuracy by 40%, and 'CashFlow,' a MERN finance tracker deployed on AWS EC2 with a full CI/CD pipeline and Redis caching, which reduced data payload by 60%.",
        "passion": "I am driven by the challenge of solving complex problems, whether it's designing efficient AI-driven workflows, optimizing application performance, or architecting scalable cloud deployments. My strong grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms (900+ problems solved) fuels my passion for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.",
